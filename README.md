# eclipse_2017
Some scripts I wrote in advance of the 2017 eclipse.

plot_gpx.py will plot the data present in eclipse_data_2017.gpx on a map of the US.

cloudy_data_to_csv.py was an attempt to use the Wunderground API to gather cloud cover likelihood for the date of the eclipse. It requires a Wunderground key to function.
